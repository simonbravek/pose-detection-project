# pose-detection-project
This is a long term research project as a part of school Maturita Exam. 
The main focus is to contribute to the improvement of 3D human body pose recovery from a single input image. 

In my case I focus on the use of [DensePose](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/main/projects/DensePose) model together with the [SMPLX](https://github.com/vchoutas/smplx).

I will reach out to fill in more soon...
